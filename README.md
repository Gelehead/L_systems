# L-Systems
This is a project about pseudo ranodm procedural generation based on context-free grammars.

For now, the project isn't really more than creating an image of a flower / pant from a set of rules.

## Documentation

see [main document file](documentation/main_doc.md) (still placeholder for now)

## grammar expansion
given a vector of symbols, terminals and non terminal. Iterate through every one of them and apply at random one of the rules that apply to them ( probabilities might apply )

__Pitfalls__? :
 - probabilities should add up to 1
 - restricted to chars (no string symbols)
 - aa
 - aa

## Expanding the project
Would be some really different directions for this

 - (__unlikely__) ML research
 - (__very likely__) Map generation
 - (__unlikely__) Compilation
 - (__uhhhhh__) highly modular python API interface
