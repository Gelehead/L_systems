### First relevant commit 
Main idea added, skeletons of classes

### Documentation and main symbol system
working on debugging infinite recursion when printing symbol class with overloaded "<<" operator

Documentation added although most of it is placeholder

### file reading and grammar printing WORKINGG
fully functionnal printing and file reading

### more expansible framework
Transformed most of the symbols into symbol vectors to support bigger grammars

### got images working now
Everything is working, pipeline is well setup with `run.bat` running main.exe, outputing a string in `cpp/output/gram.txt`, read by `interpreter.py`, which will make a turtle drawing out of it
