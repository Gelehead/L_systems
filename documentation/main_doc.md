# Summary

## often used commentary linguo
 - '??' : unclear purpose of following code
 - 'Note :' : good to know, might be of use to optimize code

## Ideas, notes, wtv
I'm questionning the whole pointer idea. It migh be a good idea to get the reference thing done now because it might compromise the exection some time in the future.

### [Logs](logs.md)
Only relevant commits will be mentionned, some are just daily commit things to have a pretty github profile

### [Grammar.h](grammar_h.md)
The backbone of this whole application. 

TODO :
 1. Add positional awareness of grammar
    - Grammar should generate randomly then adapt to its own generation by situational / positional awareness : when some consistuent appear, it should generate / destroy other specific consistuents.

### [Consistuent.h](Consituent.md)
"Constituent" term coming from ( or at least first heard of in ) "Context-Free Grammars and Constituency Parsing" - Speech and Language Processing. Daniel Jurafsky & James H. Martin. Proposed by a friend.
